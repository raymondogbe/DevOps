QUESTION:
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to set up a Nagios monitoring tool to monitor some applications, services etc. 
They are planning to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. Below you can find more details.

1) Create a deployment nagios-deployment for Nagios core. The container name must be nagios-container and it must use jasonrivers/nagios image.

2) Create a user and password for the Nagios core web interface, user must be xFusionCorp and password must be LQfKeWWxWD. (you can manually perform this step after deployment)

3) Create a service nagios-service for Nagios, which must be of targetPort type. nodePort must be 30008.

You can use any labels as per your choice.

Note: The kubectl on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.


SOLUTION
create deployment and service
# vi nagios-deployment.yaml
# kubectl create -f nagios-deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nagios-deployment
  labels:
    app: nagios-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nagios-deployment
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nagios-deployment
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nagios-container
        image: jasonrivers/nagios
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nagios-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nagios-deployment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30008

Once this is deployed, try to get the pod name and log into it using:
# kubectl exec -it (pod name) -- /bin/bash

You can use the "whereis" nagios to know the path nagios is
nagios-deployment-74ccd9c66d-m4z4r is the pod name

Use the command below to create a user name xFusionCorp and you will later be prompted for a password.
#root@nagios-deployment-74ccd9c66d-m4z4r:/# htpasswd /opt/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users xFusionCorp
