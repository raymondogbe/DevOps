An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details:

Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.

Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.


SOLUTIONS
What happened here was that the container was exited, that is, it was not running.
I had to start it.
Upon running the http://localhost:8080, I was able to access it.
Now, I had to use the docker inspect <container name> to check if it was properly mounted.
I checked under the MOUNT section and saw that it is properly mounted.
I accessed the container using docker exec it <container name> to check the file and I was able to see it under /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html
Same file was also in the host under /var/www/html/index.html
