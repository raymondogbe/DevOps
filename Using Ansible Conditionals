QUESTION:
The Nautilus DevOps team had a discussion about, how they can train different team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks. There are numerous ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each aspect that Ansible offers. The team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals to perform the following task:

An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included.

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the below given tasks.



Copy blog.txt file present under /usr/src/devops directory on jump host to App Server 1 under /opt/devops directory. Its user and group owner must be user tony and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy story.txt file present under /usr/src/devops directory on jump host to App Server 2 under /opt/devops directory. Its user and group owner must be user steve and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy media.txt file present under /usr/src/devops directory on jump host to App Server 3 under /opt/devops directory. Its user and group owner must be user banner and its permissions must be 0777 .

NOTE: You can use ansible_nodename variable from gathered facts with when condition. Additionally, please make sure you are running the play for all hosts i.e use - hosts: all.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.



SOLUTIONS:

---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  tasks:
    - name: "copy blog.txt to /opt/devops"
      copy:
        src: /usr/src/devops/blog.txt
        dest: /opt/devops/
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: '0777'
      when: ansible_nodename == "stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com"
    - name: "copy story.txt to /opt/devops"
      copy:
        src: /usr/src/devops/story.txt
        dest: /opt/devops/
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: '0777'
      when: ansible_nodename == "stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com"
    - name: "copy media.txt to /opt/devops"
      copy:
        src: /usr/src/devops/media.txt
        dest: /opt/devops/
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: '0777'
      when: ansible_nodename == "stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com"

 To run the anisble playbook, use ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
 
 Please, note that in order to get the correct host/node name, you should use the "ansible -i inventory all -m setup" command. 
 Otherwise, you might see the "skipping" in your ansible playbook.
 

 
 ansible -i inventory all -a "ls /opt/devops/"   To verify instead of logging into the remote host individually
 
 To validate:
 thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible -i inventory all -a "ls /opt/devops"
