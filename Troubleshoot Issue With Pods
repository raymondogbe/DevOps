QUESTION:
One of the junior DevOps team members was working on to deploy a stack on Kubernetes cluster. 
Somehow the pod is not coming up and its failing with some errors. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please look into it.

There is a pod named webserver and the container under it is named as httpd-container. It is using image httpd:latest

There is a sidecar container as well named sidecar-container which is using ubuntu:latest image.

Look into the issue and fix it, make sure pod is in running state and you are able to access the app.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.



SOLUTION

Check the status of the Pods
#kubectl get pods

I realised that the pod name webserver has 2 containers, one is running and the other is not.
NAME        READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
webserver   1/2     ImagePullBackOff   0          43s

Check the detailed description of the pod
#kubectl describe pods webserver
I saw that the image had issues. It was httpd:latests instead of httpd:latest

To edit a pod
#kubectl edit pods webserver

Once that was done, I waited for few seconds and rechecked the status of the pods and both containers are now running.

NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webserver   2/2     Running   0          7m2s
