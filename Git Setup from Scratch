QUESTION:
Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project. They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with. Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.

a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/news.git.

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/news.git repo.

c. Clone /opt/news.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news directory.

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_news in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.

f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.


SOLUTION:

Install git
# yum install git

Configure username and email
# git config --global user.name "Ray Ogbe"
#git config --global user.email debillion13@gmail.com

Create a bare repository /opt/news.git
#git init --bare /opt/news.git

Copy the update hook
cd into the /opt/news.git and copy the below
#cp /tmp/update hooks/

clone
cd into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/
#git clone /opt/news.git

Create a branch.
cd into the news directory, that is, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
#git checkout -b xfusioncorp_news
#cp /tmp/readme.md .

Add and commit to the new branch
#git add readme.md
#git commit -m "added readme"
#git push origin xfusioncorp_news

Create a master branch from the xfusioncorp_news branch
#git checkout -b master

push your master to origin
#git push origin master (This should give error because of the update hooks)
