QUESTION
nce we have been using it for other automation tasks. Below you can find more details about the task:

We have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, which should have all the app servers added already.

There is a ZIP archive /usr/src/security/nautilus.zip on jump host.

Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible/ directory on jump host itself to perform the below given tasks.



Unzip /usr/src/security/nautilus.zip archive in /opt/security/ location on all app servers.

Make sure the extracted data must has the respective sudo user as their user and group owner, i.e tony for app server 1, steve for app server 2, banner for app server 3.

The extracted data permissions must be 0655

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.



SOLUTION

I had difficulty in trying to understand how to place or set the owner and group names

Change the directory to ././ansible and write the playbook
- name: Extract files
  hosts: stapp*
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Extract the archive and set the owner persmission
      unarchive:
        src: /usr/src/security/nautilus.zip
        dest: /opt/security/
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"   : This obviously mean the names of the users as seen in the inventory file. jinja2 placeholder was used to call the user
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: 0655
 
 Run the playbook
 #ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
 
changed: [stapp03]
changed: [stapp02]
changed: [stapp01]
