QUESTION:
We have an application running on Kubernetes cluster using nginx web server. 
The Nautilus application development team has pushed some of the latest changes and those changes need be deployed. 
The Nautilus DevOps team has created an image nginx:1.19 with the latest changes.

Perform a rolling update for this application and incorporate nginx:1.18 image. The deployment name is nginx-deployment

Make sure all pods are up and running after the update.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.




SOLUTION
Rolling update is all about upgrading a deployment to the lastest image.
What the task is asking me to do is to set the deployment container image to 1.18

kubectl get all:  Helps us to have a view of the pods, services and deployment

kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment

kubectl get deployments

#kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment --revision=1

#kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.18. # The nginx-container is the name of the container. This is the rollingupdate command

This command set the image of the deployment to 1.18
