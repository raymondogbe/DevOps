QUESTION:
Nautilus Application development team wants to test the Apache and PHP setup on one of the app servers in Stratos Datacenter. 
They want the DevOps team to prepare an Ansible playbook to accomplish this task. Below you can find more details about the task.

There is an inventory file ~/playbooks/inventory on jump host.

Create a playbook ~/playbooks/httpd.yml on jump host and perform the following tasks on App Server 1.

a. Install httpd and php packages (whatever default version is available in yum repo).

b. Change default document root of Apache to /var/www/html/myroot in default Apache config /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf. 
Make sure /var/www/html/myroot path exists (if not please create the same).

c. There is a template ~/playbooks/templates/phpinfo.php.j2 on jump host. 
Copy this template to the Apache document root you created as phpinfo.php file and make sure user owner and the group owner for this file is apache user.

d. Start and enable httpd service.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory httpd.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.



SOLUTION:
---
- hosts: stapp01
  become: yes
  become_user: root

  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd packages  
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    - name: ensure httpd is running
      service:
        name: httpd 
        state: started
        enabled: yes
    - name: Install php packages 
      yum:
        name: php
        state: present
    - name: lineinfile
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        # The String to Search
        regexp: "/var/www/html"             
        # The String to Replace
        line: "/var/www/html/myroot"
        state: present
    - name: "Create a directory"
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/myroot
        state: directory
        owner: apache
        group: apache
    - name: copy phpinfo.php.j2 
      copy:
        src: /home/thor/playbooks/templates/phpinfo.php.j2
        dest: /var/www/html/myroot/phpinfo.php
        owner: apache
        group: apache

NB
Use the following syntax to validate the installation of the packages in the remote server
rpm -qa | grep httpd 
rpm -qa | grep php

To validate the change in the httpd.conf
grep myroot /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

There are other ways of doing similar thing
Instead of using yum, some use packages
Instead of using lineinfile, some use replace
Instead of copy, some use the template module
