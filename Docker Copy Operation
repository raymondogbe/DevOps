QUESTION:
The Nautilus DevOps team has some conditional data present on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. There is a container ubuntu_latest running on the same server. 
We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. Below are more details about the task:

On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from docker host to ubuntu_latest container (running on same server) in /opt/ location. 
Please do not try to modify this file in any way.



SOLUTION
Change the server to App Server 2 using ssh username@servername
docker image ls  ---- To check the docker images
docker ps   ----- To check the docker container name 

Make sure that you are logged into the root.
Change the environment to /tmp
Us the below command to copy the file from docker host to the docker container
#docker cp nautilus.txt.gpg 2e044acd0875:/opt

To verify, use the below command to enter into the docker container.
docker exec -it 2e044acd0875 /bin/bash
