QUESTION
The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. 
One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. 
Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

a. Create a docker network named as news on App Server 2 in Stratos DC.

b. Configure it to use bridge drivers.

c. Set it to use subnet 192.168.0.0/24 and iprange 192.168.0.2/24.




SOLUTION

To check the available networks on docker
#docker network ls

To create docker network with the requirements in the task above:
#docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.0.2/24 news (news is the name of the network)

To check if all the requirements were properly carried out
#docker network inspect news
