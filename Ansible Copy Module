QUESTION
There is data on jump host that needs to be copied on all application servers in Stratos DC. Nautilus DevOps team want to perform this task using Ansible. 
Perform the task as per details mentioned below:

a. On jump host create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory and add all application servers as managed nodes.

b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml to copy /usr/src/devops/index.html file to all application servers at location /opt/devops.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.



SOLUTION
Create and inventory for all the nodes
#vi inventory
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_user=tony
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_user=steve
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_user=banner


Create a playbook.yml to contain the play to copy the file from the server to the remote hosts

#vi playbook.yml
---
- hosts: stapp*
  become: yes 
  tasks:
    - name: copy index.html to opts/devops 
      copy:
        src: /usr/src/devops/index.html
        dest: /opt/devops
      tags:
        - simple_copy
Run the command to carry our the files copy
#ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

When you are done, ssh into each of the host to confirm
