QUESTION
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/beta.git. 
This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

a. Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). 
Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.


SOLUTION
SSH into the storage server
#ssh natasha@storage

Create new branch
cd into /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta and create new branch
#git checkout -b <devops>


Copy the index.html file into the branch
# cp /tmp/index.html . OR /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta

Do a git add
#git add index.html

Do a git commit
#git commit -m "added a new file index.html"

Do a git checkout to master according to the question
#git checkout master


Merge the branch "devops" to master branch
#git merge devops


Push the changes to master
#git push origin master


The task was alittle confusing because at first, I thought that I was supposed to create a new folder in the cluster folder.
Reading the question on a second time, then, I realized what to do.
