QUESTION:
One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. 
He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name ecommerce:datacenter. 
Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. 
So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.



a. On App Server 1 save the image ecommerce:datacenter in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.


SOLUTIONS
Using #docker images, it list all the images

To save the image in an archive
#docker save ecommerce:datacenter > ecommerce.tar

To Transfer the saved image to another host (stapp03)
#scp .tar ecommerce.tar banner@stapp03:/home/banner. scp means server copy

To Load the image
docker load < ecommerce.tar

If the docker is not running on the stapp03, please, start the service if docker is already installed, otherwise, you may have to install docker first.
Once the ecommerce.tar is loaded, the image in it is loaded.
