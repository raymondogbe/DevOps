QUESTION:

There is a production deployment planned for next week. The Nautilus DevOps team wants to test the deployment update and rollback on Dev environment first so that they can identify the risks in advance. Below you can find more details about the plan they want to execute.



Create a namespace xfusion. Create a deployment called httpd-deploy under this new namespace, It should have one container called httpd, use httpd:2.4.25 image and 4 replicas. The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2. Also create a NodePort type service named httpd-service and expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008.

Now upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43 using a rolling update.

Finally, once all pods are updated undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster



SOLUTION:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: xfusion
  name: httpd-deploy
  labels:
    app: httpd
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 2
      maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: httpd:2.4.25
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80


---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  namespace: xfusion
  name: httpd-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: httpd
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30008

kubectl get all -n xfusion
kubectl set image deployment/httpd-deploy httpd=httpd:2.4.43
kubectl -n xfusion describe deployments httpd-deploy | grep -i image  -  To get the latest image
kubectl -n xfusion describe deployments httpd-deploy  - To get the description status of the pods

#kubectl -n xfusion set image deployment/httpd-deploy httpd=httpd:2.4.43  -  This command is a rollingupdate command
kubectl rollout undo deployment/httpd-deploy -n xfusion  - This command is for a roll back to the previous update
OR
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=1    - 1 here is mean the previous update, if 2, it means the 2 previous update

kubectl rollout history deployment httpd-deploy --revision=1 -n xfusion   - This command gives details of the rollback
