QUESTION:
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. 
Below are more details about the task:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).

Use revert news message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit


SOLUTION
Git revert is just a way of reverting a commit to the earlier or previous state. 
This is different from a git reset because git reset will reset the project to default, that is, starting from the beginning.

# change the environment to storage server
# ssh natasha@ststor01

# git log --  this will give you a log of all commits

#git revert HEAD -- This open a vim page to edit. Here, instead of writing HEAD, you can actually enter the hash of the commit that you want to revert
Enter the commit message for the revert, that is, git commit "revert news" inside the vim environment.
