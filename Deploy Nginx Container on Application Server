QUESTION:
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. 
They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 2. Complete the task with the following instructions:


On Application Server 2 create a container named nginx_2 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.


SOLUTION:
docker run -dit --name nginx_2 -p 80:80 nginx:alpine

-dit = To run in interactive mode and detached mode and to continue on a running state
--name nginx_2 = The name for the container
-p 80:80 = The port number for the Host and Container to be exposed
nginx:alpine = The image to run
