QUESTION:
The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.



We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using the playbook perform below given tasks:

Install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0644 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

- hosts: stapp0*
  become: yes
  name: play1
  tasks:
  - name: "Install web server"
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
  - name: "Start web server"
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
  - name: lineinlife
    lineinfile:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      line: 'Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!'
      insertbefore: 'This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!'
      state: present
      create: True
      owner: apache
      group: apache
      mode: 0644
  
  
 Though the code was combined, but I had to install the first line of text and then later used the "insertbefore" to input the new line of text.
 The reason is because if i use the code as stated above, the first text file will not be created but the "line" text will be created.
 
 
 To remove the text already there:
 ---
- hosts: stapp0*
  become: yes
  name: play1
  tasks:
  - name: "Install web server"
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
  - name: "Start web server"
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
  - name: lineinlife
    lineinfile:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
      regexp: 'Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!'
      state: absent
      owner: apache
      group: apache
      mode: 0644
      
      
  The inventory
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.125.10 ansible_ssh_pass=****** ansible_user=gona
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.125.11 ansible_ssh_pass=******** ansible_user=acid
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.125.12 ansible_ssh_pass=******** ansible_user=babna
