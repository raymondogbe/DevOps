QUESTION:

The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/cluster.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. 
Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repo add a new remote dev_cluster and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git repository.

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.


SOLUTIONS:

Change to the right server
#ssh natasha@ststor01

Change to the right directory repo
# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/

Add the remote repo and point it to the git repo
#git add remote dev_cluster /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git

Copy files
#cp /tmp/index.html .

Check status of the git
#git status

Initialize git into the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/ repo
#git init

Add the file to git
#git add .

Commit the git
#git commit -m "newly added index.html file"

push master branch to this new remote origin.
# git push -u dev_cluster master

To validate
# git branch -a
