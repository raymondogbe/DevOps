QUESTION:
One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. 
A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:

a. Create an image blog:datacenter on Application Server 2 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.





SOLUTION:
Since we already have a container running on the server, we can check using #docker ps -a

To create an image using the container, 
#docker commit <name of the container> <name you want to give to the image>
e.g docker commit ubuntu_latest blog:container

Just to tag
docker tag <image-id> <name you want to give to the image>
