QUESTION:
The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. 
Find below more details to accomplish this task:

Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. 
Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.



SOLUTIONS
git status
git stash list - List out all the stash files
git stash apply stash@{1}    - To apply without removing the stash (I used this for the task)
git stash pop stash@{1}    - To apply and remove the stash
git commit -m "file-name"
git push
