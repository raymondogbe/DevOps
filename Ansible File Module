QUESTION
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to test several Ansible modules on servers in Stratos DC. Recently they wanted to test the file creation on remote hosts using Ansible. Find below more details about the task:



a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and add all app servers in it.

b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /home/app.txt on all app servers.

c. The /home/app.txt file permission must be 0655.

d. The user/group owner of file /home/app.txt must be tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.


SOLUTION

INVENTORY
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_user=tony
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_user=steve
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_user=banner


PLAYBOOK

---
- hosts: stapp*
  become: yes  (This is very important because it gives the "sudo" command to the anisble. 
  tasks:
    - name: "Create a blank file"
      file:
        path: /home/app.txt
        state: touch
        owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
        mode: '0655'
        
        
 ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
 
 ansible -i inventory all -a "ls /home/"   To verify instead of logging into the remote host individually
